# Computer Graphics Algorithms in OpenGL (C++)

Welcome to the **Computer Graphics Algorithms in OpenGL** repository! This collection features a variety of interactive algorithms implemented in C++ using OpenGL. These programs cover fundamental topics in computer graphics that are commonly studied in academic courses.

## Overview

This repository includes the following files:

### Basic Programs
- `Hut.cpp`: A hut, showcasing basic design principles.
- `2dAnimation.cpp`: Animation capabilities to 2D scenes.

### Drawing Algorithms
- `Bresenhams_Line_Algorithm.cpp`: Efficient line-drawing algorithm using integer arithmetic.
- `DDA_Line_Algorithm.cpp`: Digital Differential Analyzer for line rendering.
- `Circle_Ellipse.cpp`: Drawing circles and ellipses interactively.
- `Ellipse.cpp`: Focused implementation of ellipse-drawing algorithms.

### Clipping and Filling
- `Clipping_Liang_Cohen.cpp`: Liang-Barsky algorithm for line clipping.
- `Filling_Algo.cpp`: Demonstrates area-filling algorithms.
  
### 2D and 3D Transformations
- `2dTransformation.cpp`: Interactive implementation of 2D geometric transformations.
- `3dTransformation.cpp`: Demonstrates 3D transformations like scaling, rotation, and translation.
  
### Bézier and Fractal Patterns
- `BezierCurve.cpp`: Created a program utilizing Bézier curves.
- `Fractals_pattern1.cpp` and `Fractals_pattern2.cpp`: Created visually appealing fractal patterns.

## Features
